This is the Ruby code for lesson 8: Drawing Text

Rename text3d-(your platform).so to text3d.so for this
to work

I currently have only included the C-Extension for
linux. I will try to get the versions for Mac and
Windows as soon as I can. To compile the C-Extension
yourself, see the instructions in extension-instructions.txt
