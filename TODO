== TODO:

Current Goals
* Finish the Drawing Text lesson in Part 2
* Get a pure Ruby implementation of the BMP loader (to get rid of the sdl dependancy)
** Be sure the BMP loader properly flips the images and their color values, as BMP files are stored upside down
* Add the comments back in. In some files they were removed during translation
        and others need to be added in so you know whats happening (so you can learn!)
* Implement the difficult-to-translate parts in a ruby C-extension

Future Goals
* Finish all of Part2
* Make the programs not crash when minimized

Far Future Goals
* Finish the whole tutorial series
* Do exercises
* Port to Ruby 1.9
