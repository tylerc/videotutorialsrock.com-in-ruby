== TODO:

Current Goals
* Finish the terrain lesson in Part2
** Get the rest of the tutorial working
* Get a pure Ruby implementation of the BMP loader (to get rid of the sdl dependancy)
** Be sure the BMP loader properly flips the images and their color values, as BMP files are stored upside down
* Add the comments back in. In some files they were removed during translation
        and others need to be added in so you know whats happening (so you can learn!)

Future Goals
* Finish all of Part2
* Make the programs not crash when minimized

Far Future Goals
* Finish the whole tutorial series
