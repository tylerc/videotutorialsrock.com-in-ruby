== TODO:

Current Goals
* Finish the terrain lesson in Part2
** Implement the Vec3f Class
** Get the heightmap loader working
* Get a pure Ruby implementation of the BMP loader (to get rid of the sdl dependancy)
** Be sure the BMP loader properly flips the images and their color values, as BMP files are stored upside down
* Add the comments back in. In some files they were removed during translation

Future Goals
* Finish all of Part2

Far Future Goals
* Finish the whole tutorial series
