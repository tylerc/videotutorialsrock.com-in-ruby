This is a translation of the OpenGL video tutorials on videotutorialsrock.com
from C++ to ruby

This code requires rubysdl and rubyopengl
these can be installed with commands
gem install rubysdl -y
gem install ruby-opengl -y
(note these gems may require outside dependanies, you can find out which ones from their respective websites)

I am currently looking for help in any area. 

This is an unofficial port of the code, I have no affiliation with Bill Jacobs of videotutorialsrock.com
