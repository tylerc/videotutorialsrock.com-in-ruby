The lessons and the files corresponding to them
Lesson 1: basicshapes.rb
Lesson 2: transformations.rb
Lesson 3: color.rb
Lesson 4: lighting.rb
Lesson 5: textures.rb *
Lesson 6: alltogether.rb **

* The textures.rb file contains an almost identical implementation as the
tutorial, but because of the way SDL loads Bitmaps the colors are wrong,
textures2.rb trys to fix this in a roundabout way, but the end effect looks
slightly different than it should

** The file appears to be correct, but it is not. The pixels array is
reversed, making the end result look almost perfect, except the picture
is reversed thusly videotutorialsrock on the image becomes kcorslairotutoediv

The problems should be fixed soon, but for now they are good enough
